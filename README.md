# LearningDockerK8s

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my learning journey into the world of Docker and Kubernetes. 

As I transition towards a career in cloud and DevOps engineering, this repository serves as both a personal tracker and a showcase of my developing skills. 

I'm currently studying for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification.

## Learning Goals
- **Docker Mastery**: Acquiring a thorough understanding of Docker, from basic setup and commands to advanced features like networking and volumes.
- **Kubernetes Proficiency**: Learning the architecture, ecosystem, and operational skills needed to manage Kubernetes clusters effectively.
- **Real-World Applications**: Implementing Docker and Kubernetes in practical projects to demonstrate their utility in a professional cloud setting.

## Journey Outline
This repository is structured to reflect the phases of my learning journey:
- **Phase 1**: Docker Basics – Initial setup, understanding basic commands, and creating Dockerfiles for simple applications.
- **Phase 2**: Advanced Docker Techniques – Exploring networking, persistent storage with volumes, and managing multi-container applications.
- **Phase 3**: Getting Started with Kubernetes – Understanding its core concepts, setting up a basic cluster, and deploying simple applications.
- **Phase 4**: Mastering Kubernetes – Focusing on advanced topics like state management, application scaling, security, and maintenance.
