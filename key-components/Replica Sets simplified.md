### What is a ReplicaSet?

A ReplicaSet makes sure that a specific number of copies (replicas) of your app are always running.

### Key Points:

1. **Pods:** Smallest part of your app in Kubernetes.
2. **Replicas:** Copies of your pod.

### How It Works:

- **Desired Number:** You tell the ReplicaSet how many copies of your pod you want.
- **Monitoring:** It keeps an eye on how many pods are running.
- **Adjusting:** If a pod dies, the ReplicaSet creates a new one. If there are too many, it deletes some.

### Why Use a ReplicaSet?

- **Always Running:** Ensures your app always has the right number of pods running.
- **Handles Failures:** Automatically fixes things if pods crash.
- **Easy Scaling:** Change the number of replicas to scale your app up or down.

### Example:

You want your web app to always have three instances running.

1. **Create a YAML File:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: ReplicaSet
   metadata:
     name: webapp-replicaset
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: webapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: webapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: webapp
           image: nginx:latest
   ```

2. **Apply the YAML File:**

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f webapp-replicaset.yaml
   ```

### What Happens Next:

- **Creation:** Kubernetes makes three copies of your web app.
- **Watching:** The ReplicaSet watches these copies.
- **Fixing:** If one copy dies, it makes a new one.

### Summary:

- A ReplicaSet keeps the right number of copies of your app running.
- It ensures your app is reliable and can recover from failures automatically.
