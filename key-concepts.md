## Docker images
**Definition**
A Docker image is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient package that includes everything needed to run a software application: code, runtime, libraries, and environment settings.

**Analogy**  
Think of it like a recipe that contains a list of ingredients and instructions needed to create a dish. Once you have the recipe, you can make the dish (or in Docker's case, run a software application) consistently every time.

## Docker containers 
-   A running instance of an image 
-   You can run multiple containers from 1 image 
-   Definition

A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It packages not only the software and its dependencies but also the entire runtime environment, making it run consistently across different computing environments.

**Analogy**

Think of a Docker container as a home that's built from a blueprint (the Docker image). This home is fully furnished and ready for someone to live in. Just like you can build homes from the same blueprint in different locations, you can run containers from the same image on different machines, and they will function exactly the same way.

## Kubernetes Cluster 

**Definition**

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of node machines for running containerized applications. This cluster manages the orchestration of these containers, handling aspects like deployment, scaling, and networking automatically.

**Analogy**

Imagine a Kubernetes cluster as a team of workers in a factory. Each worker (node) has a specific job, such as assembling parts (running applications), managing the workflow (orchestration), or scaling production up or down depending on demand (scaling services). This team works together to ensure the entire factory operates smoothly and efficiently, just as a Kubernetes cluster ensures your applications run effectively across the nodes.

## Docker Registries 

**Definition**

A Docker registry is a storage and content delivery system, holding named Docker images, available in different tagged versions. Users can pull images from the registry to deploy containers or push their own images into the registry for sharing and collaboration.

**Analogy**

Think of a Docker registry as a library, and each Docker image as a book. Just as you can check out books from the library or donate books for others to read, you can pull images from a Docker registry to use or push your own images to the registry for others to access. This library system ensures that users can easily share and access a wide variety of images to use for their own container deployments.
